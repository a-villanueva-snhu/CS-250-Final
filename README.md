# CS-250-Final
The final project for CS-250 Software Development Life Cycle

This project is a final Sprint Review and Retrospective for the SNHU Travel Site project. The Travel project was developed over the course of the class as an attempt to simulate the SDLC within an Agile/Scrum framework. We spent time acting as Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer and Tester. 

In the project we were both given and created user stories to simplify project features and guide development. User stories, made while acting as a Scrum Product Owner, give Developers tangible feature goals and Testers can create highly specific test cases. 

While developing the features for the project, we closely followed the Scrum framework, and emulated the major interactions that follow:
 - Gathering and updating information from Users and Stakeholders
 - Converting information into user stories and test cases
 - Developing with industry best practices and communicating progress
 - Testing features continuously; communicating bugs; updating test cases
 - Organizing Springs and Retrospectives after each phase for reflection and improvement

Using the Agile method with a Scrum framework has taught me how to adapt projects and workflows to changing needs and roadblocks, while keeping strong, efficient communication practices and clean organization - hallmarks of a good team member.

We also leared about using tools like Kanban boards, project management software like Asana and Trello, and sprint managers like Zoho or Jira.
